Just three friends enjoying solving problems with code and doing it together here. Wroking out our brain muscles while chatting over a call. Plus, this is super-relevant for coding interviews. [Nice](https://youtu.be/0NfO4AAwGf4)!

The workflow is a weekly meeting during which each one would present his solution to the others, and a monthly mock interview.

## Neetcode

This is our starting point. A well-crafted list of problems which get you the most bang for your buck. We'll see where we go from here!
